Krita ( https://krita.org) is a sketching and painting program with animation features planned in version 3.0.

What really caught my attention was the animation below of the cat from Pepper and Carrot in a post on Google+ by David Revoy at https://plus.google.com/+DavidRevoy/posts/FXihXUn9X1w

I was reminded instantly of my fondness for Disney Animation Studio (DAS) on my family's Amiga when I was a kid. In this video from 1990, you can see a demo of creating 12 cells in 40 seconds (of water dripping): https://youtu.be/qSeYivHZpB8?t=30s 

Basically, DAS excelled at emulating old-school, paper flip books that kids like me loved to make. They look like this:

Out of the box Krita: 2.9.9 Animation Edition (beta) isn't set up to create flip books quickly. It would be tough to make 12 frames in 40 seconds. However, you can add [keyboard shortcuts](https://userbase.kde.org/Krita/Manual/TopMenu/Settings#Configure_Shortcuts) for "next frame" and "previous frame" in the timeline. Then you hit the "Delete" key to make a new frame. It works well enough. Here's my quick sketch of water dripping:

Now I need some ideas of what to draw. My friend Jim used to draw a crocodile (or dragon?) that looked something like this:

My kids decided to draw a smiley face:

Then we brought to life "Flip-O-Rama #4" from one of their favorite graphic novels:

Oh, at https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=342479 it looks like they'll be working on animated gif export, which is great especially since https://krita.org/item/the-votes-are-in-2/ indicates a lot of people voted for this as a stretch goal, but in the meantime you can just save as PNG from "Export animation" and "Export Sequence" and then use this ImageMagick command: `convert -delay 3 -loop 0 *.png out.gif`
