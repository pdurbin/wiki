I went to http://devconf.us 2019 and had the following on my profile at https://devconfus2019.sched.com/philipdurbin

<p>Since 2012 Phil has been a developer for <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse">Dataverse</a>, open source research data repository software installed by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataverse.org">46 organizations</a> around the world and translated into <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/GlobalDataverseCommunityConsortium/dataverse-language-packs">10 languages</a>, at the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a> at Harvard.</p>
<p>In 2017 Phil stood up Dataverse on <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="http://guides.dataverse.org/en/4.15.1/developers/containers.html">OpenShift</a> which lead to him co-mentoring the Spring 2018 Cloud Computing Course from Boston University and Northeastern where students worked on scaling Dataverse on OpenShift and released a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/BU-NU-CLOUD-SP18/Dataverse-Scaling#our-project-video">video</a> demonstrating the improvements from their merged pull requests. (At the same time Dataverse was being integrated with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/dataverse-community/P4llZSssZ2Q/zvhGltLpAQAJ">Spark</a> using the Open Service Broker API by another group of students for the same course.) Later that summer, Phil mentored two interns at Red Hat who continued to make <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/pull/4827">pull</a> <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/pull/4924">requests</a> related to running Dataverse better on OpenShift that were QA'ed and merged. All these efforts were lead by Dan McPherson from Red Hat who summarized them in a talk called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataversecommunitymeeting20.sched.com/event/F7eq/dataverse-on-openshiftkubernetes">Dataverse on OpenShift/Kubernetes</a> at the 4th annual <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://dataverse.org/events">Dataverse Community Meeting</a> that fall and the Dataverse community has continued to build upon them in repos focused on <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-docker">Docker</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse-kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to enjoying the fantastic content at DevConf.US, Phil is hoping to continue conversations with attendees he has spoken with in other contexts. In particular he enjoyed the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://osf.io/ksmjh/">Open Data Hub</a> poster from the 5th annual Dataverse Community meeting, the recent workshop for the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/osshealthindex/attendee-list">Open Source Software Health Index Project</a>, and collaborations with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow me noopener noreferrer" href="https://osf.io/ksmjh/">Mass Open Cloud</a>.</p>
