I started a thread called "What did you enjoy about LibrePlanet 2019?" at https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-discuss/2019-04/msg00001.html that includes some of the feedback below.

What did you enjoy about LibrePlanet?

The people, the FSF open house, the talks, the hallway track, hanging out at Scholars, Deb being recognized, hanging out at Grendels. It was all great.

What would you change about LibrePlanet? 

This year I attended my second ever FSF Associate Member Meeting and I'm concerned that I couldn't remember much about what we talked about last year. Notes were taken but they are gone now. I'd like to suggest that there could be a second, even more optional "on the record" member meeting where notes are made public afterward. I wrote more about this at https://forum.members.fsf.org/t/what-happens-to-the-notes-from-the-annual-fsf-associate-member-meeting-at-libreplanet/1050

What were three of your favorite sessions? 

- Hackerspace Rancho Electrónico
- Governing the software commons
- Sharing opportunities in the Wikipedia community

Please list up to three topics you would like to see more of at LibrePlanet. 

1. Increasing diversity.
2. Science.
3. Design.

Is there anything else you would like us to know?

Tarek Loubani's talk was very powerful.

Before the conference a post crossed by radar called "Is LibrePlanet Safe?" written by Eric Schultz and signed by many former speakers ( https://wwahammy.com/on-safety-at-libreplanet/ ). I guess I'm wondering if the FSF plans to respond.

I'm wondering if you would consider an "opt in" list of attendees to make it easier for people to connect afterwards.
