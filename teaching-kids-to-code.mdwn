I've been teaching my kids how to code on and off since they were six. At a young age, it's better to think of it as creating animations using [[Scratch]] or similar. The older they get and they more they're already playing games, they'll be better at making games.

A good way to start is with [[code.org]].

Coding is much more fun if you can share your work with others. If the kid can bring an iPad to a friend's house, great, use [[Hopscotch]]. If you want to email a link to your game to Grandma, you should probably use [[Scratch]] but until Scratch 3 comes out, Grandma will have to have Flash installed.

If you have Android devices lying around, try [[MIT App Inventor|app-inventor]]. 

As your kids get older, you'll want to transition them to "real" coding with text rather than blocks. Check out [[Greenfoot]] and [[Phaser]].

On each of these pages, you'll see more of my thoughts on the various options:
