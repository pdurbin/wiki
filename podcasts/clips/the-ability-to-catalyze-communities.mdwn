"I think one thing that is really interesting is the community aspect of open source. Having the ability to catalyze communities is a really unusual corporate competency and that is something that we really feel makes Red Hat Red Hat because we're able to work with communities, non Red Hatters and regular customers, so effectively and help them be effective in communities. I think that's something that is worth mentioning as something that's quite unusual and other organizations, I think, will need to develop the ability to work well in communities beyond a command and control environment."
