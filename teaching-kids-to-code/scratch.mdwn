Scratch is awesome but the current version requires Flash to play. Here are my family's profiles:

Some day [Scratch 3][] will be out and it will support HTML5 instead of Flash.

There's also [ScratchJr][], which is a tablet app for children as young as five.

[[Hopscotch]] is very similar to Scratch but it's iPad only and you can't publish your work to the web.

Scratch is open source. Version 2 can be found at https://github.com/LLK/scratch-flash but I'm holding off until Scratch 3 which seems to be at mostly at https://github.com/llk/scratch-blocks according to https://scratch.mit.edu/developers . The ScratchJr source code can be found at https://github.com/LLK/scratchjr

If your kids are ready to advance beyond Scratch, I recommend [[Phaser]].

A friend of mine has his kids using Scratch to program a cute little robot called [Cozmo][].
