On February 2nd, 2020 I gave a talk at FOSDEM called "Advancing Science with Dataverse."

The talk is on [YouTube][] and my [slides][] are available on the FOSDEM website.

Thank you, everyone, for coming. Again, my name is Philip Durbin. I'm a software developer at Harvard University. This is a picture of our campus. We're across the river from Boston in the United States. I'm here to tell you about Dataverse.

Dataverse is a community of data enthusiasts, specifically research data. That means that we are scientists, researchers, and often we come from the academic library world, so librarians and data curators, data scientists, sotware developers like myself.

These are some pictures from our annual gathering in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We have our sixth annual this June and every one welcome to come. We always play what we call soccer.

For importantly for FOSDEM, Dataverse is open source software. We are Apache licensed.

52 installation of Dataverse around the world across six continents.
It has been translated into 10 language.
Over 100 contributors
We are written in Java
Javascript, Python, R

Lots of ways to get involved.
