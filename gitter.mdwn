In August 2018 I asked about a Gitter roadmap at https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/contributing?at=5b83daefff44515616449c0a and it sounds like there isn't one. On the short list were these two issues:

- threaded discussions: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/741
- notification bugs: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/webapp/issues/1205
