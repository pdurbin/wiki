Notes

- 4-6 stories per week
- In order to maintain this pace (of 4-6 stories per week), and not get bogged down by manual regression testing, the team invests heavily in automated testing and continuous integration.
- Product backlog (queue), "backlog grooming."
- We need product owners who can say "no."
