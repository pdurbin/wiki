 **Feedcritic** would allow you to rank, review, and categorize podcasts on your own website as well as rate or review individual episodes. I'm playing around with code at http://podcasts.greptilian.com and some [notes on Feedcritic][] where comments are welcome

 **Outsiders** would allow you easily filter your GitHub issues down to the ones that weren't created by members of the project. An example [query][] would be `is:open repo:pdurbin/addressbookmvc -author:pdurbin -author:dhutty`.
